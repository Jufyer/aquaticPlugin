# Aquatic Minecraft Plugin

This Minecraft Plugin adds many features related to the Ocean to Minecraft. The plugin is completely inspired by a post on [`X`](https://x.com/home) by [`@Vitreous_Glassy`](https://x.com/Vitreous_Glassy). You can find the post [`here`](https://x.com/Vitreous_Glassy/status/1784074035615203770).

## Installation

1. Install the plugin like any other Minecraft plugin.
2. After installation, you need to either use the provided resource pack yourself or set it as mandatory for the whole server. You can find the resource pack by going to the [`releases`](https://github.com/Jufyer/aquaticPlugin/releases) or on [`MediaFire`](https://www.mediafire.com/file/b5hbhxbay5jlw54/Aquatic+Resourcepack.rar/file).
3. To set it as mandatory, follow [`this tutorial`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCVPgn3IppU) by [`@KasaiSora`](https://www.youtube.com/@KasaiSora) on YouTube.
4. You also need OptiFine. If you don't want to use OptiFine you can use these two mods: [`[ETF] Entity Texture Features`](https://modrinth.com/mod/entitytexturefeatures) and this one: [`[EMF] Entity Model Features`](https://modrinth.com/mod/entity-model-features).

You can download the latest release [`here`](https://github.com/Jufyer/aquaticPlugin/releases).

If you kill the Nibbler it drops a Prismarine Shard.

## Oyster

The Oyster is a new Block. But this block cant be broken so you cant get the Block. There a two variants:
- Without a Pearl: 
  - <p align="center"><img src="https://imgur.com/PT4vd79.png"></p>
- And with a Pearl: 
  - <p align="center"><img src="https://imgur.com/mXMZKrQ.png"></p>
  
If you shear an oyster it always drops a raw oyster. And if the oyster has a pearl it also drops it. It will look something like this:
<p align="center"><img src="https://imgur.com/pdRJdfE.png"></p>

If you eat the Oyster raw you will get nausea but if you cook it you will get a good food source. You can cook it in the furnace like any other food like this:
<p align="center"><img src="https://imgur.com/9aNDFPF.png"></p>

And if you get the Pearl you can brew a potion of Luck with it. You can to it like that:

## Boat Banners

If you shift-right-click a boat with a banner in your hand you can place the banner in the boat. It will look like this: 

<p align="center"><img src="https://imgur.com/xUyvEmg.png"></p>

But if you do that there can only be one Player in the boat. So it basically takes up one place in the boat. You can also get the banner by back shift-right-clicking again. 

## Goldfish

The Goldfish is a new mob without any functionality. It is just there for the looks and spawns together with tropical fish. You can see it here:
